# Delivery Plan — Digicraft Consulting

## Completed
- Typography + theme: switched to Space Grotesk (display) and Manrope (body), refreshed color tokens and gradients for light/dark.
- Components + sections: sticky navbar with theme toggle, hero, services, showcase/case-study grid, process/about, testimonials, contact CTA, polished footer.
- Interaction polish: framer-motion reveals, elevated cards, scroll-smooth anchors.

## In Progress
- Replace placeholder external links (case studies, social) with production URLs.
- Add real project imagery or illustrations for showcase tiles.

## Next Up
1) Content + SEO polish: tighten copy, add meta/OG tags, structured data for services.  
2) QA: responsive sweeps, accessibility checks (aria labels, focus order, color contrast).  
3) Analytics & forms: hook up contact form or calendaring + analytics stack (GA/Matomo/Segment).  
4) Performance: run `pnpm build` once Node is available; monitor LCP/CLS with Lighthouse.
